        Many European countries experimented with wealth taxes in the late 20th

        main: "In the decades after World War II, several European countries introduced annual net wealth taxes as part of a broader move towards progressive taxation and welfare-state expansion. Wealth taxes were seen as a way to ensure that those with substantial assets contributed more to rebuilding and social spending.",
        notes:
          "By around 1990, roughly a dozen OECD countries levied some form of individual net wealth tax, including Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.",

        title: "Austria abolishes its wealth tax",
        main: "Austria was one of the first European countries to abolish its net wealth tax in the mid-1990s. The government argued that the tax was complex, raised little revenue, and risked harming competitiveness in a world of increasing capital mobility.",
        notes:
          "Austria’s repeal foreshadowed a wider trend: other European states soon followed, citing administrative costs, avoidance and concerns about investment.",

        main: "Denmark and Germany both abolished their net wealth taxes in 1997. In Germany, constitutional court rulings raised questions about unequal treatment of different assets. In Denmark, high marginal tax rates on wealth were seen as discouraging saving and pushing capital abroad.",
        notes:
          "Both cases are often cited in debates about constitutional constraints and the difficulty of maintaining a broad, neutral base for wealth taxes over time.",

        main: "The Netherlands abolished its traditional wealth tax and moved to a system that taxes a deemed (assumed) rate of return on net wealth in \"Box 3\" of the income tax. Instead of taxing the stock of wealth directly each year, the tax base is an imputed return on savings and investments.",
        notes:
          "This reform is sometimes classed as a move away from wealth taxation, but economically it still taxes the ownership of assets through a stylised return.",

        main: "Finland and Iceland both abolished their wealth taxes in 2006, citing administrative burdens, limited revenue, and worries about capital flight. Iceland later reintroduced a temporary wealth tax after the financial crisis but only for a few years.",
        notes:
          "These cases illustrate how wealth taxes may be used as temporary crisis measures, but are difficult to sustain once economic conditions change.",

        main: "Sweden abolished its wealth tax in 2007 after decades of complaints that it encouraged wealthy residents to move assets abroad or even emigrate. The tax base had eroded over time as assets were exempted or shifted into forms less exposed to the tax.",
        notes:
          "Despite abolition, Sweden remains a high-tax Nordic welfare state. This case is often used to argue that wealth taxes can be politically fragile even in relatively egalitarian societies.",

        notes:
          "Some regions, like Madrid, effectively apply a 100% rebate, meaning the tax is paid mainly in other regions. This internal tax competition weakens the overall base.",

        notes:
          "The abolition of ISF was controversial: critics saw it as a tax cut for the rich, while supporters argued it would reduce capital flight and support entrepreneurship.",
